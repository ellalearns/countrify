# countrify

## Description:
Countrify is an app that connects to a REST API to get the list of countries and their properties.

## Features:
The features include:
Two screens -- One home and one country_details screen
Data is passed from the recycler view in the homepage to the details screen following it
The app is responsive
It has a dark mode feature
Both screens are scrollable

## Libraries
I used:
Retrofit: for getting data from the API
Glide: for loading images from the internet
JSON to Kotlin: for converting the JSON object to a Kotlin data class

## Code base
The whole app is written in Kotlin. It is made up of a recycler view for the first page, and a recycler view adapter. I also have a view model class and a data class for modeling the data. Intent was used to pass the data between the two screens.

## Challenges I faced:
I had to learn view models and how they work
Plus NEPA shege ðŸ˜­

## If I had more time:
I would have made the app a little more responsive, and cleaned up a few bugs.
